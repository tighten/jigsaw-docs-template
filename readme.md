# Jigsaw Docs Starter Template

This is a starter template for creating a beautiful, customizable documentation site for your project with minimal effort. You’ll only have to change a few settings and you’re ready to go.

## Installation

After installing Jigsaw, run the following command from your project directory:

```bash
./vendor/bin/jigsaw init docs
```

This starter template includes samples of common page types, and comes pre-configured with:

- A fully responsive navigation bar
- A sidebar navigation menu
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility CSS framework that allows you to customize your design without touching a line of CSS
- Syntax highlighting using [Prism.js](https://prismjs.com/)
- A script that automatically generates a `sitemap.xml` file
- A search bar powered by [Algolia DocSearch](https://community.algolia.com/docsearch/), and instructions on how to get started with their free indexing service
- A custom 404 page

### Configuring your new site

As with all Jigsaw sites, configuration settings can be found in `config.php`; you can update the variables in that file with settings specific to your project. You can also add new configuration variables there to use across your site; take a look at the [Jigsaw documentation](http://jigsaw.tighten.co/docs/site-variables/) to learn more.

```php
// config.php
return [
    'baseUrl' => 'https://my-awesome-jigsaw-site.com/',
    'production' => false,
    'siteName' => 'My Site',
    'siteDescription' => 'Give your documentation a boost with Jigsaw.',
    'docsearchAppId' => '',
    'docsearchApiKey' => '',
    'docsearchIndexName' => '',
    'navigation' => require_once('navigation.php'),
];
```

> Tip: This configuration file is also where you’ll define any "collections" (for example, a collection of the contributors to your site, or a collection of blog posts). Check out the official [Jigsaw documentation](https://jigsaw.tighten.co/docs/collections/) to learn more.

### Adding Content

You can write your content using a [variety of file types](http://jigsaw.tighten.co/docs/content-other-file-types/). By default, this starter template expects your content to be located in the `source/docs` folder. If you change this, be sure to update the URL references in `navigation.php`.

The first section of each content page contains a YAML header that specifies how it should be rendered. The `title` attribute is used to dynamically generate HTML `title` and OpenGraph tags for each page. The `extends` attribute defines which parent Blade layout this content file will render with (e.g. `_layouts.documentation` will render with `source/_layouts/documentation.blade.php`), and the `section` attribute defines the Blade "section" that expects this content to be placed into it.

```yaml
---
title: Navigation
description: Building a navigation menu for your site
extends: _layouts.documentation
section: content
---
```

### Adding Assets

Any assets that need to be compiled, such as JavaScript or CSS using Tailwind, can be added to the `source/_assets/` directory. Vite will process them when running `npm run dev` or `npm run build`, and the processed assets will be stored in `/build_local` or `/build_production`, respectively.

Files that don't need processing (like images and fonts) can be placed in `/source/assets/` and will be included in the build as-is.

## Building Your Site

Now that you’ve edited your configuration variables and know how to customize your styles and content, let’s build the site.

```bash
# run development server
npm run dev

# build static files with Vite
npm run build
```
